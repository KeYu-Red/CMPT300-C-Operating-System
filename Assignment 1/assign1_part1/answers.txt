1)
The temp is just a pointer, and it is not allocated any space. So when using strcpy, you can not 
copy the string to that pointer.

2)
A string type includes the character '\0' as the end tag, so the string 
actually contains 10 characters. But the array temp only has 9 char space.

3)
The pointer buffer points to a string constant, 'strcpy' operation will attempt to
modify the value of a constant, which is forbidden.

4)
Correct. A simpler expression for &b[0] is b.

5)
output: 5 abc

6)
The function myfunc() creates a local array variable buffer which has no certain
value after the function completed, so argument s doesn't get a exact value and will
be NULL then and fail to be printed.
